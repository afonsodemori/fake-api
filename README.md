# About

**fake-api** is a project for studying purposes. First of all, studying how to implement an API, HATEOAS, and _lo que me apetezca_...

The API will then be used in some simple Front-end projects that I'm developing... also for studying purposes, like [https://status.afonso.io]() / [https://apis.afonso.io/status]().
